    <h2>ACHTUNG - CSRF Fehler ist aufgetreten </h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        CSRF stands for Cross Site Request Forgery. It is a security vulnerability
        that forces an end user to unknowingly let attackers perform malicious actions
        on the end user's behalf within the sensitive website they are currently authenticated
        into such as their bank or social media account.

        In order to perform these type of attacks, attackers would typically know the end user’s
        activity along with CSRF vulnerable websites the end user has access to. If the end user
        happens to visit the attacker’s site while authenticated to the website (such as user's
        ank account), the attacker could perform malicious action on the end user's behalf
        potentially damaging the user’s possession in the their authenticated website.
